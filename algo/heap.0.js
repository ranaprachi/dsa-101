// Heap
// - A type of Tree 
// - Two types :
//     - Max Heap : parent nodes are always greater than its children
//     - Min Heap : parent nodes are always smaller than its children
// - nodes at the same "level" don't follow any rule besides being higher/lower than their parent
// - Binary heaps are used to implement priority queues, also used in Dijkstra's path-finding algorithm
